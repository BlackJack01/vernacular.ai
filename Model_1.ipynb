Maybe it\\nwas there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with\\nSCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device\\nwith a SCSI-2 controller chip.\\nSCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.

However, expressing\\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\\n    exceed their technical skills.\\n\\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\\n    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\\n\\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\\n    composing imagery for understanding.\\n\\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\\n    computer graphics context.\\n\\n\\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\\n\\n        Psychology/Perception:\\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\\n            Beverly J.

The first attempt failed in the summer\\n\\tof 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules\\n\\tstate that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started\\n\\tafter a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).\\n\\tThis is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and\\n\\tcomp.os.os2.bugs.\\n\\n\\tThis document contains:\\n\\t*  the background showing the need for these proposals\\n\\t*  the proposed charters for these proposals\\n\\t*  voting instructions\\n\\t*  a voting ballot\\n\\t*  some example ballots\\n\\t*  the voting rules\\n\\t*  the voting schedule\\n\\t*  the Mass Acknowledgement\\n\\n\\nBackground:\\n\\n\\tThe creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2\\n\\tand emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred\\n\\ta continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such\\n\\tas emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and\\n\\tmuch more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,\\n\\tallowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.\\n\\n\\tMuch of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and\\n\\tlater, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the\\n\\tnumber of people asking questions about OS/2\\'s compatibility\\n\\twith their hardware increases, as does the questions on the\\n\\tavailability of drivers for their hardware, installation\\n\\tprocedures, etc.\\n\\n\\tMultimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows\\n\\tMultimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is\\n\\tincluding direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version\\n\\t2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).\\n\\n\\tAny non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,\\n\\tespecially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.\\n\\tSo far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks\\n\\t(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or\\n\\tfor free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read\\n\\tcomp.os.os2.misc for details).\\n\\n\\nProposed Charters:\\n\\n\\t(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)\\n\\n\\t\\tIt will provide a forum for developers of ported software so\\n\\t\\tas to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and\\n\\t\\tspur additional development.  The group will also cover\\n\\t\\ttopics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,\\n\\t\\tWindows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program\\n\\t\\tportability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and\\n\\t\\tso forth.\\n\\n\\t(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)\\n\\n\\t\\tTo keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy\\n\\t\\torthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.\\n\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup\\n\\t\\tfor OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and\\n\\t\\ttechnical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.\\n\\n\\t(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)\\n\\n\\t\\tIt will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the\\n\\t\\tavailability of device drivers, compatibility information,\\n\\t\\tinstallation procedures, system requirements, and overall\\n\\t\\tperformance optimization.\\n\\n\\t(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)\\n\\n\\t\\tIt will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.\\n\\n\\t(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)\\n\\n\\t\\tIt will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug\\n\\t\\tdiagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system\\n\\t\\tpatches and corrective service disks, and so forth.\\n\\n\\t\\t[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other\\n\\t\\tnewsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.os2.beta]\\n\\n\\nHow to Vote:\\n\\n\\tTo cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.\\n\\tMany newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this\\n\\tpost.

Where can I get patches to X11R5?\\n\\n\\tThe release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced\\nin the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.\\n\\n\\tPatches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other\\nsites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the \\nnewsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in \\ntheir source distributions of X11.\\n\\n\\tPeople without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has \\n23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line\\n\\t\\tsend fixes #\\nwhere # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.\\n\\n\\tHere are a few complications:\\n\\t1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request \"5a\", \"5b\", \"5c\" and \\n\"5d\" separately\\n\\t2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was \\nre-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn\\'t work with Solaris]\\n\\t3) fix 8 is in two parts: \"8a\" and \"8b\"\\n\\t4) fix 13 is in three parts: \"13a\", \"13b\", and \"13c\"\\n\\t5) fix 16 is in two parts: \"16a\" and \"16b\"\\n\\t6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which \\npreviously was optional\\n\\t7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff\\nby asking for \"PEXlib.uu.[1234]\".\\n\\t8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, \"22a\" through \"22i\"\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?\\n\\n\\tThe xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail \\nit a request, and it mails back the response.\\n\\tAny of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The\\nxstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can \\nhave several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). \\nThe xstuff server treats the \"Subject:\" header line just like any other line \\nof the message.\\n\\tThe archives are organized into a series of directories and \\nsubdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an \\nindex. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the \\nsubdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.\\n\\n\\t1) The command \"help\" or \"send help\" causes the server to send you a \\nmore detailed version of this help file.\\n\\t2) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"index\", then \\nthe server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If\\nthere are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then \\nthe indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. \\nFor example, you can say \"send index fixes\" (or \"index fixes\"). A message that \\nrequests an index cannot request data.\\n\\t3) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"send\", then the\\nxstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name \\nan item, you give its directory and its name. For example\\n                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9\\n\\tYou may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many \\nsafeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large \\namounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed\\namount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the \\nday\\'s quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. \\nWhenever the mailer is run to send its day\\'s quota, it sends the requests out \\nshortest-first.\\n\\t4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting \\nreturn addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won\\'t get any response.  If \\nyou happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like\\n        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu\\nor\\n        path bar!foo!frotz\\nin the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.\\n\\n\\tThe xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If \\nyour mailer deals in \"!\" notation, try sending to \\n{someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.\\n\\n[based on information from the MIT X Consortium, 8/89, 4/90.]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  60)!

However, just in case\\nsomething went wrong, I\\'m going to describe some of the changes needed\\nto get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed\\nthat installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when\\nyou\\'re not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in\\nthe section called, \"Windows 3.1 runs slowly\".\\n\\n\\n* MSDOS configuration:\\n\\n     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your\\nCONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,\\nyou\\'ll notice that you\\'ll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive\\n(this is the default setup).  You\\'ll also notice that your system runs\\nmuch, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section\\ncalled, \"Windows 3.1 runs slowly\", for some ways of speeding your system\\nup.\\n\\n\\n* Windows configuration:\\n\\n     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the\\n\"[388Enh]\" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:\\n\\n\\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\\n\\nI believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry\\nto SYSTEM.INI, but I\\'m not sure.  If this doesn\\'t work for you, you\\nmight want to try adding some more lines:\\n\\n\\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\\n\\tSystemROMBreakPoint=false\\n\\tEMMExclude=A000-CFFF\\n\\n(You probably don\\'t need the above lines, though.)  The\\n\"SystemROMBreakPoint\" entry is used to enable support for memory\\nmanagers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).\\n\\n\\n* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:\\n\\n     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that\\nyour system is running much slower than before.  If it\\'s not, it\\'s\\nprobably because:\\n\\n     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your\\n\\tCONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a\\n\\twinning solution.\\n\\n     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to\\n\\tbe seen ....\\n\\nIf your system is running much slower than before, this is almost\\ndefinitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the\\nWindows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808\\n(\"SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS\"), you must use\\nSmartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really\\nslows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a\\nfactor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other\\nsolutions.\\n\\n     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you\\ndo, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even\\ndestroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.\\nWhat you can do is one of the following:\\n\\n     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my\\n\\topinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused\\n\\teither by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in\\n\\tSmartdrive.\\n\\n     2. Use a driver that provides \"VDS\" services (\"VDS\" stands for\\n\\t\"Virtual DMA Services\").  This is a standard, which is supported\\n\\tby Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like\\n\\tthe 1542) to work with Windows.\\n\\n     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following\\nsolutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I\\nam now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused\\nby these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following\\ndoes not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is\\nstrongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:\\n\\n1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI\\n   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two\\n   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your\\n   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\\n\\n\\tDRIVER=c:\\\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\\n\\n   (Windows needs the \"/V386\" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into\\n   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies\\n   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be\\n   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it\\'s\\n   still there).\\n\\n2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version\\n   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers\\n   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\\n\\n\\tDRIVER=c:\\\\ASPI4DOS.SYS\\n\\tDRIVER=c:\\\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\\n\\n   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high\\n   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would\\n   crash my system, but it doesn\\'t.  I asked Adaptec\\'s technical support\\n   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine\\n   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.\\n\\n   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would\\n   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting\\n   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my\\n   C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes\\n   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE\\n   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason\\n   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.\\n\\n   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of\\n   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.\\n\\n   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without\\n   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider\\n   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.\\n\\n3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is\\n   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer\\n   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS\\n   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not\\n   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only\\n   three ways to get a copy:\\n\\n      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver\\n\\tkit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other\\n\\tdrivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is\\n\\taround $75.\\n\\n      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you\\n\\tcan supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for\\n\\taround $30.\\n\\n      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0\\n\\tfor MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in\\n\\tdifferent directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is\\n\\tincluded; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two\\n\\thard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy\\n\\tof ASPI4DOS 3.1.\\n\\nNote, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with\\nWindows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing\\nthis, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above\\nsolutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk\\naccesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the\\nparity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off\\ntiming for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I\\'ve run various\\nmemory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no\\nproblems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal\\ntiming requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers\\n(this is why the memory tests didn\\'t find any problems -- the problems\\nshow up only under disk I/O).  However, I\\'m mentioning this just in case\\nit isn\\'t a hardware problem.\\n\\n\\n***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:\\n\\n     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a\\nfloppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory\\nSystems Jumbo 250:\\n\\n1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive\\n   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.\\n\\n2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.\\n   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.\\n   However, I\\'ve heard of other people having similar problems, and so\\n   I\\'m mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my\\n   1542.)\\n\\n\\n* Tape backups/restores take a long time:\\n\\n     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may\\nhave to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 \"bus on/off timing\" for best\\nresults when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup\\nor restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with\\nonly an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the\\nAdaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,\\nstart and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the\\ntape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective\\ntape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).\\nThis also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer\\nthan necessary.\\n\\n     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to\\ntransfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA\\nto transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs\\nto feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is\\nnot fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,\\nrewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).\\nThe default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is\\n\"too large\".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be\\ntransferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the\\ntape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec \"hogs\" the memory too\\nmuch (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to\\nmemory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the\\ntape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,\\nbecause data is not fed to it quickly enough.\\n\\n     The solution is to change the Adaptec\\'s bus on/off timing.  The\\ndefault factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.\\nThe \"bus on\" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can\\nbe done in one of two ways:\\n\\n* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the \"/n\" option.  For example, I use\\n  a \"bus on\" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the\\n  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:\\n\\n\\tDEVICE=c:\\\\aspi4dos.sys /n4\\n\\n  Note that there is NO space between the \"/n\" and the \"4\".\\n\\n* If you don\\'t have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a\\n  program called \"SETSCSI.EXE\", which is very difficult to find.  The\\n  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to\\n  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for\\n  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have\\n  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to\\n  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have\\n  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:\\n\\n\\tsetscsi -n:4\\n\\n  This adjusts the \"bus on\" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running\\n  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the\\n  factory defaults.\\n\\n  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use\\n  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I\\n  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.\\n\\nDo not lower the \"bus on\" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it\\nabove 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk\\nthroughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4\\nmicroseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may\\nhave to adjust it downwards a little.\\n\\n     Once you\\'ve lowered the \"bus on\" timing, tape backups and restores\\nshould run faster.\\n\\n     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other\\noptions that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what\\nyou are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by\\nstarving memory refresh.\\n\\n     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless\\nthis has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),\\nthis is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple\\nof other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the\\nbus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried\\nrunning this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I\\nwas running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn\\'t check to see if there was a\\nconflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,\\nalthough the docs say that it works with the 1542A?\\n\\n\\n* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:\\n\\n     This \"problem\" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my\\nsystem, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.\\nHowever, I\\'ve heard of other people having similar problems, and so I\\'m\\nmentioning this just in case it isn\\'t a hardware problem just on my\\n1542.\\n\\n     Symptoms of this \"problem\", which persists even after cleaning the\\ntape head:\\n\\n1. Backing up to tape encounters \"unusable sector detected\" errors,\\n   resulting in an aborted tape backup.\\n\\n2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.\\n\\n3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.\\n   Unlike the above-mentioned problem (\"Tape backups/restores take a\\n   long time\"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,\\n   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.\\n\\n4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other\\n   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software\\n   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the\\n   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.\\n\\n5. Too many tape read errors.\\n\\n     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered\\nthat using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I\\nupgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy\\ncontroller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I\\ninitially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I\\ndecided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on\\nthe motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)\\nreliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly\\nable to find and use the tape drive.\\n\\n     I don\\'t know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.\\nOn the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached\\nto the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the\\n1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn\\'t work well attached to\\nthe 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different\\ncontroller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my\\n1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that\\nthe problem was in the cables.  I don\\'t know what the cause really is;\\nhowever, if you\\'re having similar problems, you might want to consider\\ntrying a new floppy controller.\\n\\n\\n***** Sound cards:\\n\\n     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and\\nthis is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the\\nAdaptec\\'s DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the\\ntape DMA, this \"conflict\" usually manifests itself as a parity error\\n(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is\\nthat, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the\\nAdaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a\\nparity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a\\nhardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity\\nerror is not a symptom of bad hardware.\\n\\n     I\\'ve found that such parity errors typically occur while recording\\ndigitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase\\nthe recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,\\nrecording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).\\n\\n     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the\\nAdaptec\\'s \"bus on\" timing.  See the section on tape drives for\\ninformation on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may\\nnot solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity\\nerror.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect\\nthis problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the\\nspeed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also\\naffect this.\\n\\n\\n***** Miscellaneous info:\\n\\n     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much\\nof it is merely information that I\\'ve heard or read about, and have not\\nverified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I\\'m\\nnot sure.  Use it at your own risk.\\n\\n* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the \"DB=\"\\n  parameter (e.g., \"DB=2\"), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.\\n  If you don\\'t, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM\\n  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that\\n  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM\\n  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install\\n  program -- I haven\\'t tested any other version).  Earlier versions of\\n  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I\\'m not sure (I\\'ve never used a\\n  version earlier than 6.00).\\n\\n  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the \"DB=\" parameter.\\n\\n* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one\\n  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you\\n  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I\\'m not sure if this is\\n  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.\\n\\n* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and\\n  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces\\n  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three\\n  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following\\n  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand\\n  information):\\n\\n     1. You can buy Adaptec\\'s EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for\\n\\tsomething like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,\\n\\tyou can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact\\n\\tAdaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains\\n\\teverything that you need.\\n\\n     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the\\n\\tsame people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM\\n\\tdrivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know\\n\\tthe list price, but I\\'ve seen this package sold for around\\n\\t$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS\\n\\tdriver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,\\n\\tyou may be better off getting Adaptec\\'s EZ SCSI instead.\\n\\n     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been\\n\\tobsoleted by Adaptec\\'s EZ SCSI kit, but I\\'m mentioning it in\\n\\tcase someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the\\n\\tdrivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410\\n\\tkit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of\\n\\tMSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in\\n\\tthe ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin\\n\\tboards.\\n\\n* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows\\n  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I\\'ve heard about are\\n  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how\\n  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the\\n  following is secondhand information):\\n\\n     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large\\n\\tnumber of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers\\n\\t(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.\\n\\n     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup\\n\\tprogram (see the above section on CDROM drives for more\\n\\tdetails).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but\\n\\trequires, ASPI4DOS.\\n\\n* I\\'ve seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:\\n\\n     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.\\n     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.\\n     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and\\n\\tCorelSCSI! drivers/programs.\\n\\n  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:\\n\\n     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI\\n\\tdrivers).\\n\\n* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar\\n  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you\\n  need this driver before you can use this program).

Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats\\nas well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.\\n\\n\\t\\t    Image Analysis & Processing\\n\\n\\tFor image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an\\nassortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and \\nmathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution \\nproduct or principal component analyses.\\nAn interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows\\nthe user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively.\\nStandard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig\\nonometric and transcendental functions.\\n\\n\\t\\t    Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis\\n\\n\\tSphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity\\nfor various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.).\\nThe simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and\\nsurface conditions and instrument spectral bands.\\nA geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation,\\nand 3-D image projection.\\n\\n\\t\\t    Easy External Program Interfacing\\n\\n\\tSphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally\\ndeveloped software algorithms for processing and converting satellite\\nobservations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters\\nto external programs using special interface functions.\\n\\n\\t\\t    Quick Quality Presentation\\n\\n\\tSphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution\\nmultispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image\\nplanes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images,\\ngraphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports.\\nSphinx\\'s 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying\\nand integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as \\nhistograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale\\noutput for standard inkjet and laser printers.\\n\\tOther Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external \\ngraphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?\\n\\n\\t\\t    Software Support & Development\\n\\n\\t Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d\\'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)\\n of the Universite de Lille, France.\\nThe package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at\\nthe French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),\\nand the French space agency, Centre National d\\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES).\\nAt LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing\\nresearch needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features\\non-line help, is supported by an Internet address\\n\\n sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and\\n version updates provided without delay.\\n\\n\\t\\t    Performance Tested\\n\\n \\tCNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data \\ncollected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.

I have only one report, which seems to indicate\\n> that a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! \\n\\nOk.  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache.\\nIt\\'s small enough that I will attach it.\\n\\nI have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB\\ncache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to\\n40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective\\ndifference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache\\ncard certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously\\nbetter.  I do not have an FPU.\\n\\nThe conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers\\noffer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference\\nbetween 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well\\nunder $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.\\n\\nIf you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I\\'d like to\\nsee them.  Let\\'s check the conventional wisdom!  The so called\\n\"Performance Rating\" numbers by themselves are of no interest. \\n\\nCheers.\\n\\n(This file must be converted with BinHex 4.0)\\n:#@0KBfKP,Q0`G!\"338083e\"$9!!!!!!\\'A!!!!!$qK3%\"a+!!!!BGJ&CfGiGfH(H\\n)GhQ!QSQBUC!!@SQUU(QSCfPhGhL(H+HCL&KjQTU)LDH)HBL*UCUCJ!U@GQ9hGiK\\nhCAKR9SPiJ)QRQ)QUJ+N(J!UCLD#U#S!!S!QUUTQC#U#DL3J)#3LT#UU)QUUBUT!\\n!S!L3!!UU#!QJS+UT!!QJS*UD#TUUQCQ3!*!!UCFJ!!%c4ACSL\\'D)L)D!#!!)#!!\\n!!!!!!!!)!!!!!!!!J!B8*%9@9L0A\"i!!G`!!G`B!!(J)\"i###B!P[US),B\")21Z\\n-1I\"k-cQFM-VXMHhA!irdjPcVr,lUCVSZ2SI8j@,-l,jPI`F#lZq0A\"AL8XRHjf,\\n6[LJ09\"aZ2TV6l!$9lN@eAP@Rei8(VIpIQkfDK$-ZV[b+9[T5lkC0XZ6LGhf(Ik&\\na$Lkh*Q6-qhh2MIlc*Q2Iq$p([GeSp(ejN!\"bHMdHll$&Qh\\'lR`E26C2(QBqSrMM\\npa-k()jPGXqcpR2rYR9eYd0,*Mh0,h1rj1*hA%pcLHRSG6PF2eIYmc4rIS60EFp+\\nCGE@Vr$[TRAFA(QkA`pG8JkS[@fe1mcBikFQC(,(9K[U&h\"\"0rr\"BDDT(i%XP3Z$\\nV04L8D82FeU01V4K-9U#JaD@1*fZa`EZr3-eGTYkNXH49SjF2Ei[G*5el3[VZ\\'j[\\nVf($bTBHjlEX3Pe0KJ8,ZKH!9Cc3+fJ%kHGZC*BHhNV9+DC6Xd$[S58DFD\"pJ%ei\\nq#CXHkEL`@d%&PYYY\"1f0rG`jm0rJTCYMi4B1KbB\\'pUBQ)PU9\\'q\"*m1miHG#YR`b\\neUNG1\\'mSAP#mR`i-1*K`l[DiNq\\'MQjZA(,4bq\"$*Mimq(KC9@@(-Mc\\'\"f88e9U&0\\nF\\'Y4U5eXb(\"+6T8D@6(R3ae+10Padk\"CAK!*Ea6SThLiA9HF!H&&Da@[,[2bA2!p\\n2VIr&TI)!6V`%S!*eJ#GS!Q!!QqD#2P!*M49m9IdHhm2frUq2Ek))G3e\"Vi)+rQJ\\nC[`%m#+E&0jf\"YI2ql`VI&0qHH!R[339`\\'9hY46)TR+ZkXI!pQRQKCU3%ed9R&Cr\\n!QCiUk+ZmEf)IYI&bqMEffkT5bB`JhYl2K[0PXVe0B@@2*@Uam121D`A`h+cC)Xl\\nIEjf8S+#9`a6[P8p0ZC&6H0ajcY1BR\"JDM3`F%lJ1&5bI+SC2Jh([qeTfVK961rR\\nZVIq[+Rb-TH3\\'B3f0r$h\\'\\'cP%\"UY1\\'jU53jY@5P(RCdPAXAfrl\"Xrhf#Y\"dmV1i$\\n9%Dm@T+f4NMlP5jd-XN0(K5C91\\'R@)4Qb9C5Ke1h%V-kiaRA-NTa`b9(YYL5TM5*\\nF2#bUFFLGJ%,D8QA*9R`eUQ29Sj!!p0b\\'\"c5LEFR4@%9KpDGj1,bijhNaDH,6mrm\\n(3qpJITeraM0+0RHJ*aJ%f`#HJ!R4JJXDK22e!Cab5DK)jkRq0r[IcrC`[c!Krd(\\n$m1VrbJCX!NR)3FrcHYPk(r1CHJjiJ#Hk%\\'J84pq+#+$a2&r&bZ,Ff1V,-KG6qG9\\nMbmUPG9XkUeX$2Gl!Gl!Gl!GE!k5hrX(F4IX4IRNYkb\"M%rSbN4`8m8qPq2rAd[j\\nFhRC#4(PeI2RFhY0+j-GH\\'!P*S)h!#HN!R6JJXb5f\\'b!clJkfb121qGm2MclEe,S\\nmHpf12b4arQ$Q%%PLK\"q(8@I8[qRmmS5[l`\"2fP!\"4CpjY0,DDAp2AlE#eIPBD0c\\nrL1,PeXj39[%9k`HF4Z,ZKGN4h9A+b-T23l)RDf\\'a13X\"\\'-#VbKJ[!9ME*!Tlp2-\\nQckRpM@J2e5BN*f&jHN*[Vp-#f+F(J)PQXJNlYRLpQ3C,%`Cm0l3E[MP\"cXZ6`)B\\nmpVS0)P3Y@XTB5F5qaSr\"XrmrZf1iLXSV,pPVjICFMRrekXdDI`0FHmT[Q!4VL`T\\naalM336chGUr@\"Me6YarIDI&Y2LpE9HPaI#fhNFmq$qLchVC(dUajJ%eb%(6NdIH\\np#jqEd#X1cGDTVmDY965+@Pi,Mr1JeR&pq`q@\"AacVkC[0lZi3-Z-5PZk8%f$Vrd\\nHfR&1mci,3&Nqh9r\"e%\"j5Ve$0rN`AbfB\"Qqlk$C`3@LKQRh0(-MKhNYA+UC&Qhq\\n5kajHR1eFqR,2H5b8Z!SLfG3!!2TPmiF!!3!+58PcD5eMB@0SC3%!!!!)6@0S9(0\\n3C$1R$)JJT`b+33%!ADmicJ!#!!!4a3!!!!!!!!B9!!!!!,AP!!!:\\n-- \\n ----\\nPeter Newton (newton@cs.utexas.edu)\\n',\n",

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin\\n\\n\\ne. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.\\n\\nYour perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.\\n\\nSimilarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.\\n--  \\n=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=\\n Eric Choi - Internet: Eric.Choi@p5.f175.n2240.z1.fidonet.org\\n',\n",

Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire\\n(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240\\nall have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly\\nremembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all\\nof them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered\\nDESTAs (DEC\\'s oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used\\nwith a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.\\n\\nMy advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:\\n\\n(1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won\\'t add\\n    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going\\n    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which\\n    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.\\n    As for Thicknet, it\\'s a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it\\n    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).\\n\\n(2) On the Mac side, you will need:\\n    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).\\n    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won\\'t run on System 7.1).\\n    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be\\n      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don\\'t use earlier versions on a Centris).\\n    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the\\n      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is\\n      self-terminated or not.\\n    - configure MacTCP to use \"Ethernet\".\\n\\n(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:\\n    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.\\n    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.\\n      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the\\n      DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable\\n      (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).\\n    - get a 25ohm terminator.\\n\\nYour two-machine network will look like this:\\n\\n\\n       ##T----------------------------------------------[]\\n      +-----+                                           |\\n      |     |                                           |\\n      +-----+                                         +-----+\\n                                                      |     |\\n                                                      +-----+\\n    DECstation                                        Centris\\n     5000/200                                           650\\n                              OR\\n\\n       ##T----------------------------------------------[]\\n        {=}                                             |\\n      +-----+                                           |\\n      |     |                                         +-----+\\n      +-----+                                         |     |\\n                                                      +-----+\\n    DECstation                                        Centris\\n5000/25,125,133,240                                     650\\n         \\n   ##    -> 25ohm terminator\\n   T     -> T connector\\n   ---   -> Thinwire (RG58 coaxial cable)\\n   {=}   -> AUI-to-BNC (i.e. Thick-to-Thin) adapter\\n   []    -> Thickwire media adapter (assuming self-terminated)\\n   |\\n   |\\n\\nAndy\\n-- \\nAndy Sun (andy@ie.utoronto.ca)          4 Taddle Creek Road, Toronto\\nComputing Coordinator                   Ontario, Canada.

It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\\n  processing of remote sensed data.\\n\\n  For further information, please contact:\\n\\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

Supports 24-bit display\"\\n\\nHIPS\\n----\\n(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory\\'s Image Processing System)\\n\\n  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image\\n  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image\\n  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil\\n  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

       " 'From: rws@cs.arizona.edu (Ronald W. Schmidt)\\nSubject: outlining of spline surface\\nKeywords: spline rasterization\\nLines: 38\\n\\n\\n\\tAbout a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to\\nbe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if\\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \\nsolutions to it.\\n\\n\\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \\nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \\nthe object we \\n\\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\\n\\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\\n\\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\\n\\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\\n\\tmeasure.\\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\\n\\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\\n\\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\\n3) Depth sort the triangles\\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\\n\\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\\n\\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\\n\\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\\n\\n\\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\\nfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem\\nsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this\\narea.\\n\\n-Thanks\\n',\n",

Even if you don\\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send\\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \\nget a slab-o-OTIS.\\n\\nAs of 04/21/93, we\\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \\nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION?\\n\\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \\non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \\nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \\n \\nIt would also be nice if you\\'d send me a note when you did post images\\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\\n\\nIt\\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\\ncase they\\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\\naddress or other information you\\'d like people to know.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHMMM?!\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\\nYour input is expected.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \\n \\t     (a sumerian deity) or it\\'s followers, be they pope, priest,\\n\\t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations\\n\\t     however.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original \\n \\t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  \\n\\t     It\\'s possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\\n\\t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \\n    \\t     Unless you\\'ve given permission for that, it\\'s illegal.  OTIS\\n\\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\\n\\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \\n\\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \\n\\t     electronically.  If you don\\'t want your images distributed     \\n\\t     all-over, don\\'t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\\n\\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\\n\\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \\n\\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \\n\\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).

The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas\\nthe upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700\\nupgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21\"\\nwith 8 bit depth and up to 16\" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It\\nalso has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which\\nmakes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.\\n\\n  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you\\'re\\nbetter off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an\\naccelerator.\\n\\nPaul\\n',\n",

What is XFree86?\\n\\n   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with\\n   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and\\n   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:\\n\\n    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,\\n       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require\\n       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of\\n       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by\\n       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield\\n       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.\\n    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default\\n       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now\\n       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately\\n       20% faster than X386 1.2.\\n    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,\\n       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4\\n       with the \\'Advanced Compatibility Package\\', local connections from\\n       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.\\n    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.\\n       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about\\n       the ATI and Trident drivers.\\n    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt\\'s\\n       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).\\n    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is\\n       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the\\n       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.\\n    7) New configuration method which allows the server\\'s drivers and font\\n       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary\\n       distributions.\\n    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.\\n    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA\\n       cards is now included.\\n\\n   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2\\n   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):\\n\\n    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of\\n       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 \\n       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).\\n    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the\\n       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \"two\\n       headed\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only\\n       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).\\n    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.\\n    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to\\n       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for\\n       more information.)\\n    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some \\n       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).\\n    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor\\n       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous\\n       documentation and a lot of experimentation).\\n    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including\\n       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many \\n       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more \\n       information).\\n    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has\\n       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of\\n       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks\\n       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.\\n    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig\\n       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative\\n       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new\\n       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) \\n       manual page for more information on the format of this file).\\n\\n       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file\\n       in the source distribution for full details.\\n\\n   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the\\n   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.\\n\\n4. What OSs are supported?\\n\\n    XFree86 supports:\\n\\tSVR4.2: Consensys V4.2\\n\\tSVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC\\n\\tSVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2\\n\\tLinux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1\\n\\n\\tBSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active\\n\\tBSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.\\n\\n\\tNote that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,\\n\\tbut anyone should feel free to submit patches.\\n\\tIf you are interested in tackling this, send mail to\\n\\txfree86@physics.su.oz.au\\n\\n5. What video hardware is supported?\\n\\n   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:\\n\\n\\tTseng ET4000\\n\\tTseng ET3000\\n\\tParadise PVGA1\\n\\tWestern Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of\\n\\t\\tthe PVGA1, and use its driver)\\n\\tGenoa GVGA\\n\\tTrident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000\\n\\tATI 18800, 28800\\n\\n\\tAll of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,\\n\\twith the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in\\n\\t256 color mode.\\n\\n\\tThe monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of\\n\\tvideo memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the\\n\\tET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome\\n\\tserver, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.\\n\\n\\tIt appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to\\n\\tnon-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To\\n\\tavoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86\\n\\t1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel\\n\\tclock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are\\n\\tdiscovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how\\n\\tthese programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such\\n\\ta program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with\\n\\tfuture XFree86 releases.\\n\\n\\tIf you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,\\n\\tit is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the\\n\\tOrchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not\\n\\twork with them, because Diamond won\\'t provide programming details.\\n\\tIn fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond\\n\\tproducts, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions\\n\\tof code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).\\n\\tIf you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.\\n\\n\\tSome people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA\\n\\tvideo cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the\\n\\tCPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It\\n\\tcould be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset\\n\\ton the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don\\'t have a lot\\n\\tof access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested\\n\\ttheory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not\\n\\tworking on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86\\n\\tworking fine on them.\\n\\n6. What about accelerated boards?\\n\\n\\tAt this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards\\n\\tlike the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available\\n\\tin commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).\\n\\n\\tAn S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact\\n\\t<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.\\n\\n\\tA beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>\\n\\tor <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.\\n\\n7. Why doesn\\'t XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?\\n\\n\\tThe reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the\\n\\t16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory\\n\\tcontains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-\\n\\tplanes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each\\n\\tof each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-\\n\\tbuffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled\\n\\t16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code\\n\\tcould be modified to support this (or it already may; I\\'m not sure).\\n\\tBut for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer\\n\\timplementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,\\n\\tbut nothing is yet available from the project.\\n\\n8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?\\n\\n\\tObviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run\\n\\tX efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.\\n\\tThe various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending\\n\\ton the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).\\n\\tTo build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will\\n\\tbe required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable \\n\\tlower bound.\\n\\n9. Where can I get source for XFree86?\\n\\n\\tSource patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22\\n\\tfrom MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:\\n\\t\\texport.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)\\n\\t(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)\\n\\n\\tRefer to the README file under the specified directory for information\\n\\ton which files you need to get to build your distribution.\\n\\n10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?\\n\\n\\tBinaries are available via anonymous FTP from:\\n\\t\\tftp.physics.su.oz.au\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /XFree86/SVR4\\n\\t\\tftp.win.tue.nl\\t\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\\n\\t\\tferkel.ucsb.edu\\t\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/SVR4/XFree86\\n\\t\\tstasi.bradley.edu\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\\n\\t\\tblancmange.ma.utexas.edu\\t- SVR3 (ISC) binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/ISC\\n\\t\\tftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/pc/isc/XFree86\\n\\t\\ttsx-11.mit.edu\\t\\t\\t- Linux binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/linux/packages/X11\\n\\t\\tagate.berkeley.edu\\t\\t- 386BSD binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86\\n\\t\\tftp.cs.uwm.edu\\t\\t\\t- Mach binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /i386\\n\\n\\tEnsure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may\\n\\tarchive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will\\n\\tcontain a README file that describes what files you need to take\\n\\tfrom the archive, and which compile-time option selections were\\n\\tmade when building the distribution.\\n\\nIV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n11. Installation directories\\n\\n\\tThe top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot\\n\\t(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include\\n\\tfiles, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.\\n\\n\\tThis can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified\\n\\tvia symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is\\n\\tnonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed\\n\\talongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.\\n\\n12. Configuration files\\n\\n\\tThe XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\"Xconfig\") on startup.\\n\\tThe search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in\\n\\tthe server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.\\n\\n13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes\\n\\n\\tDavid E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known\\n\\tclock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.\\n\\tThe database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and\\n\\tis in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is\\n\\talso available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on\\n\\texport.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated\\n\\toccasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the\\n\\tsettings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to\\n\\tDavid for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tIf this doesn\\'t help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file \\n\\twith XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.\\n\\tIt may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use\\n\\tthis description to get them right.  When you do, send the information\\n\\tto David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tNOTE: The old \\'clock.exe\\' program is not supported any more, and\\n\\t      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot\\n\\t      clock values for a new board, remove the \\'Clocks\\' line from\\n\\t      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The\\n\\t      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.\\n\\t      You can use these values to put a \\'Clocks\\' line into your\\n\\t      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up\\n\\t      starting the server in the future.\\n\\n14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit\\n\\n\\tIf you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to\\n\\treconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is\\n\\tfully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.\\n\\nV) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n\\tFirst of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).\\n\\n15. SVR4\\n\\tWhy won\\'t my xterm run properly?\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define\\n\\tCONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won\\'t run.\\n\\tcsh users should use \\'setenv CONSEM no\\'\\n\\n\\tThe Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping\\n\\tproblems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be\\n\\tinstalled.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.\\n\\n16. SVR3\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that\\'s what you are running.\\n\\n17. 386BSD\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.\\n\\n\\tAlso, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey\\n\\t<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the\\n\\tfile XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:\\n\\n\\t    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\n18. Linux\\n\\n\\tYou must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc\\n\\tjump libraries installed.\\n\\n\\tMake sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel doesn\\'t have TCP support compiled in, you\\'ll have to\\n\\trun the server as \"X -pn\". The default startup configuration assumes\\n\\tthat TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files\\n\\t/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the\\n\\t-pn argument to X386.\\n\\n\\tMake sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major\\n\\tnumber 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not\\n\\towned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit\\n\\tconsole output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but\\n\\tstartx won\\'t.\\n\\n\\tWhen running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with\\n\\ta tty, for example \"xdm < /dev/console &\".\\n\\n\\tFor more detailed information, please read the file README present\\n\\twith the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.\\n\\n19. Mach\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.\\n\\nVI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?\\n\\n\\tThis section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is\\n\\tfully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.\\n\\tPlease look at those files for information on building XFree86.\\n\\nVII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?\\n\\n20. BSD compatibility library\\n\\n\\tA lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.\\n\\tThe default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a\\n\\twhich contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),\\n\\tseed(). A better way of providing the \\'b\\' functions is to include\\n\\t<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro\\n\\tdefinitions for these in terms of the SYSV \\'mem\\' functions.  If you are\\n\\tlinking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these\\n\\tfunctions, then you should link with libXbsd.a\\n\\n21. ANSICCOPTIONS\\n\\n\\tThis is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the\\n\\tANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite\\n\\tthe entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you\\'d see\\n\\tsomething like\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tin his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\"-ansi\"\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\\n\\tto get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death\\n\\twith -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because\\n\\tCCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must\\n\\tadd \\'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)\\' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.\\n\\nXFree86 Contact Information\\n\\n    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86\\n    Core Team.

You will see the floppy disk and\\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\\n    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back\\n\\tof the mac.\\n \\n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\\n    need release.\\n \\n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\\n    to release it.\\n                                            \\n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\\n\\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\\n    here.\\n\\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\\n\\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\\n\\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\\n\\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM\\n    slots.\\n\\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\\n    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their\\n\\tchips facing the front of the motherboard.\\n\\t\\n    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in\\n\\tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\\n\\tand firmly into a fully upright position.\\n\\t\\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\\n\\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\\n\\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\\n    into place.\\n\\t\\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\\n    DRIVE CABLE.\\n\\n12) Replace the phillips head screw\\n\\n13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\\n\\n14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\\n\\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>\\n\\n\",\n",

For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is\\nissued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other\\ndevices on the bus.

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\\nThat were not done and now we have\\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\\n -the program has human interface errors.\\n\\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\\n\\n[ ..deleted.. ]\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nSome new items follows.\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\\noption than with default option we have.\\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\\n\\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\\n(our default) in that order.

It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about\\nfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.\\nThe buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.\\n\\nAlso, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard\\nand mouse for XV after the image is completed.\\nOften it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when\\nI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings\\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\\n\\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\\nupdates the images.

You have to\\nprovide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is\\nCopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't\\nmatch its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a\\nborder-pixel, and the problem should go away.\\n\\nThere is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that\\nCopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to\\nXCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines\\nCopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so\\nyou are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib\\nimplementation not providing stricter type-checking.

If you leave a file open on a\\nfloppy drive, then change the disk and do something which updates or closes\\nthat file, you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and FAT\\nfrom the other disk written to the new disk.  This has always been true,\\nand has destroyed data under other programs, not just CView.\\n\\nThe only thing CView can do to improve the situation is to try not to leave\\nfiles open unless it\\'s actively using them (ie, reading and decoding).\\n\\n-- \\nKevin Martin\\nsigma@rahul.net\\n\"I gotta get me another hat.\"\\n',\n",

So here it comes:\\n\\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\\ndoesn\\'t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \\nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\\n\\n The result of this process is the following:\\n  \\n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\\'t performed.\\n\\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\\n        there was room on the disk.\\n\\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\\'s (1200x900 and bigger) can be\\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\\n\\n\\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\\ntable? I can\\'t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\\nsort a directory listing?\\n\\n\\nWith much thanks to the originator of this article.\\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\\n |        Rene Walter          |          renew@stack.urc.tue.nl           |\\n +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+\\n | \"Will I drown in tears of sorrow, Is there hope for tomorrow,           |\\n |  Will this world ever get better, Can\\'t we all just live together       |\\n |  I don\\'t wanna live in strife  , I just wanna live my life              |\\n |  I deserve to have a future...\"                                         |\\n |                                     -The Good Girls    \"Future\"         |\\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\\n\\n',\n",

Most of the C preprocessors that\\n        I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the\\n        line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the\\n        start of a directive. \\n\\n        However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol\\n        as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines\\n        that \"This\" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my\\n        imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better\\n        fix.\\n\\n(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular\\n        use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for\\n many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size\\n and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard\\n x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,\\n bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)\\n may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different\\n line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of\\n distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in\\n the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek\\n alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts\\n can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device\\n drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile\\n format and renderer.\\n\\n The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.\\n The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly\\n granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without\\n consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT\\n object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it\\n is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely\\n available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed\\n somewhere in the documentation for the package.\\n\\n We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of\\n user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any\\n published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,\\n which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that\\n as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the\\n kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest\\n in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only\\n afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on\\n those which help us get our work done.\\n\\n PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically\\n without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub\\n routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any\\n modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the\\n header file \"plplot.h\"; see the documentation for more details.\\n\\n The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of\\n several TeX files; please consult this for additional information (\\'latex\\n plotdoc\\').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to\\n the code, so don\\'t be surprised if some known features are not explained\\n there.  Consult \\'Changes.log\\' to see a list of recent changes.  \\n\\n At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\\n\\n\\t Unix:\\tSunOS\\n\\t\\t A/IX \\n\\t\\t HP-UX\\n\\t\\t Unicos\\n\\t\\t DG/UX\\n\\t\\t Ultrix\\n\\t\\t SysV\\n\\t\\t Linux\\n\\n\\t Amiga/Exec\\n\\t MS-DOS\\n\\t OS/2\\n\\t NeXT\\n\\n For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:\\n  - appendices to the PLPLOT manual\\n  - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.\\n\\n To become a subscriber to the PLPLOT mailing list, send a request to\\n plplot-request@dino.ph.utexas.edu.\\n\\n CREDITS\\n -------\\n\\n PLPLOT is the result of the effort of many people, so it is impractical to\\n list all the contributors.

After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were\\nintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining\\n5.41 wouldn\\'t even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and\\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\\n\\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I\\'ve called La Cie again and they\\'ve given me\\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn\\'t see\\nthe drive there\\'s a definite hardware problem.\\n\\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\\nme a *new* one, but they said \"no.\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased\\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\\n\\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that\\nwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one\\nthey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I\\'ll have to again\\nreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data\\nrecovery.)\\n\\nIt seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a\\ndiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still\\ncovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. \\n\\nI feel a little helpless about all this. I don\\'t mean to necessarily flame La\\nCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.\\nBut c\\'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent\\na letter to La Cie\\'s customer service when the first drive was returned and I\\nasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive\\nthree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply\\nthe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product.

The number of characters\\nX       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }\\nX       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.\\nX\\nX    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:\\nX\\nX---entry---\\nXrule:\\t1993\\nXfix:\\ty or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)\\nXtitle:\\ttitle of entry  \\t\\t    (see comments below)\\nXentry:\\tEntry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)\\nXdate:\\tDate/time of submission in UTC\\t    (see comments below)\\nXhost:\\tMachine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested\\nX\\tUse tab indented lines if needed\\nX---remark---\\nX    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if\\nX    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a\\nX    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th\\nX    column.  Blank lines are permitted.\\nX---author---\\nXname:\\tyour name\\nXorg:\\tSchool/Company/Organization\\nXaddr:\\tpostal address\\nX\\tuse tab indented lines to continue\\nX\\tdon\\'t forget to include the country\\nXemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.\\nX        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.\\nXanon:\\ty or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)\\nX---info---\\nXIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in\\nXthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info\\nXsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.\\nX---build---\\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program\\nXin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named \\'build\\'.  The resulting\\nXfile must be 255 bytes or less.\\nX---program---\\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode\\nXinto a file named is \\'prog.c\\'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.\\nX---end---\\nX\\nX      Regarding the above format:\\nX\\nX\\t* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*\\nX\\t  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.\\nX\\nX\\t  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should\\nX\\t  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,\\nX\\t  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.\\nX\\nX\\t* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect\\nX\\t  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()\\nX\\t  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)\\nX\\nX\\t* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending\\nX\\t  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set \\'fix\\' in the\\nX\\t  ---entry--- section to \\'n\\'.  The corrected entry must use the same\\nX\\t  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be\\nX\\t  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.\\nX\\nX\\t* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above\\nX\\t  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges\\nX\\t  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate\\nX\\t  Email message to the judges.\\nX\\nX\\t* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless\\nX\\t  \\'y\\' was given to the respective author\\'s \\'anon\\' line.\\nX\\nX\\t* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for\\nX\\t  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and\\nX\\t  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.\\nX\\nX\\t* The entry\\'s remarks should include:\\nX\\t    - what this program does\\nX\\t    - how to run the program (sample args or input)\\nX\\t    - special compile or execution instructions, if any\\nX\\t    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)\\nX\\t    - information about any ---data--- files\\nX\\t    - why you think the program is obfuscated\\nX\\t    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.\\nX\\t    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)\\nX\\nX\\t* Do not rot13 your entry\\'s remarks.  You may suggest that certain\\nX\\t  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.\\nX\\nX        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They\\nX\\t  should not be required to exist.\\nX\\nX\\t  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---\\nX\\t  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple\\nX\\t  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe\\nX\\t  each info file in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:\\nX\\nX\\t   \\'build\\' is incorporated into a makefile, and \\'build\\' is removed\\nX\\t   \\'prog.c\\' is renamed to your entry\\'s title, followed by an optional\\nX\\t       digit, followed by \\'.c\\'\\nX\\t   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry\\'s\\nX\\t       title, possibly followed by a digit\\nX\\nX       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your\\nX       entry\\'s remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a\\nX       build shell script containing the \\'build\\' information.  The name of\\nX       this build shell script will be your entry\\'s title, possibly followed\\nX       by a digit, followed by \\'.sh\\'.\\nX\\nX       If needed, your entry\\'s remarks should indicate how your entry must\\nX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.\\nX\\nX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be\\nX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,\\nX       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this\\nX       occurs, state so in your entry\\'s remarks.\\nX\\nX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.\\nX       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not\\nX       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.\\nX\\nX    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the\\nX       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.\\nX\\nX    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is\\nX       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:\\nX\\nX\\t\\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate\\nX\\t\\tobfuscate@toad.com\\nX\\nX       We request that your message use the subject \\'ioccc entry\\'.\\nX\\nX       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries\\nX       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\\nX\\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\\nX\\nX    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->\\t\\t      |\\nX\\nX\\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\\nX\\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\\nX\\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers\\nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with\\nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor\\nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\\nX\\nX\\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\\nX\\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\\nX\\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\\nX    might be \\'old\\' the next year.\\nX\\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\\nX\\nX\\t* look at the original source\\nX\\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\\nX\\t* C pre-process the source ignoring \\'#include\\' lines\\nX\\t* C pre-process the source ignoring \\'#define\\' and \\'#include\\' lines\\nX\\t* run it through a C beautifier\\nX\\t* examine the algorithm\\nX\\t* lint it\\nX\\t* compile it\\nX\\t* execute it\\nX\\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\\nX    \\'cleaned up\\' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\\nX\\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\\nX    \\'strangest/most creative source layout\\' need not do as well as\\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\\nX\\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award \\'worst abuse of the\\nX    rules\\' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\\nX\\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\\nX    annoy more than amuse.\\nX\\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award \\'worst abuse of the rules\\'\\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\\nX\\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn\\'t work.\\nX\\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\\nX    working entry is best.\\nX\\nX\\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\\nX\\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become \\'old\\'.  We\\nX    tend to \\'see thru\\' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won\\'t go as far\\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\\nX\\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\\nX\\nX\\t#define d define\\nX\\t#d foo\\t\\t   <-- don\\'t expect this to turn into #define foo\\nX\\nX\\tint i;\\nX\\tj;\\t\\t   <-- don\\'t use such implicit type declaration\\nX\\tint k;\\nX\\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you\\nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in\\nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\\nX\\nX    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       |\\nX    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    |\\nX    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.\\t      |\\nX\\nX\\tint i;\\nX\\tchar *c;\\nX\\ti[c];\\t\\t   <--- use c[i] instead\\nX\\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\\nX\\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\\nX    not portable and must not be used:\\nX\\nX\\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\\nX\\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\\nX\\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\\nX\\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\\nX\\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\\nX\\t* using va_list as a structure or union\\nX\\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **\\'s.\\nX\\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\\nX\\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\\nX    the leading \\'#\\' must be the first character on a line.  While some\\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading \\'#\\', many do not.\\nX\\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\\nX\\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\\nX\\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\\nX\\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\\nX\\nX\\t* are very hardware specific\\nX\\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\\nX\\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\\nX\\t      code is likely not to be)\\nX\\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\\nX\\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the \\'remark\\' header item)\\nX\\t* won\\'t compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\\nX\\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\\nX\\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\\nX\\t* are longer than they need to be\\nX\\t* are similar to previous winners\\nX\\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\\nX\\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\\nX    \\'best one liner\\' category, we suggest that you format your program\\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\\nX\\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D\\'s to help out,\\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D\\'s in order to\\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\\nX\\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\\nX\\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\\nX\\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the \\'smallest self-replicating\\'\\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of \\'smallest\\', lest we (or others)\\nX    know of a smaller one!\\nX\\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don\\'t\\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don\\'t depend\\nX    on color or a given size.  Don\\'t require backing store.\\nX\\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\\nX    Don\\'t use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.

This format,\\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\\nX\\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\\nX\\nX\\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\\nX\\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\\nX\\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.

Be sure to check with the\\nX\\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\\nX\\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,\\nX    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check\\nX    the entry against the size rules.\\nX\\nX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about\\nX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename\\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\\nX    we use the name of the entry\\'s title, followed by an optional\\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\\nX\\nX    If the above entry somehow won the \\'least likely to win\\' award,\\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\\nX\\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\\nX    if you did one of the following:\\nX\\nX\\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\\nX\\nX\\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\\nX\\nX\\t\\tcc prog.c -o special_name\\t\\tneed special binary\\nX\\nX\\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\\t\\t\\tneed special source\\nX\\t\\tcp prog.c special_src.c\\nX\\t\\tcc special_src.c -o special_name\\nX\\nX\\t    or  rm -f special_build\\t\\t\\tneed special build\\nX\\t\\ttail +4 build > special_build\\nX\\t\\tsh < special_build\\nX\\nX\\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of\\nX\\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You\\nX\\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\\nX\\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\\nX\\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\\nX\\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\\nX    \\'hints\\' file.\\nX\\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\\nX\\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\\nX    have entry number 0.\\nX\\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don\\'t place text outside of the\\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren\\'t\\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the\\nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\\nX\\nX\\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\\t(not the address for\\nX\\tjudges@toad.com\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t submitting entries)\\nX\\nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer\\nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as\\nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\\nX\\nX\\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\\nX\\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many\\nX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:\\nX\\nX\\tdate -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\"\\nX\\tdate -u | sed -e \\'s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\'\\nX\\tsh -c \\'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\"\\'\\nX\\tsh -c \\'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\"\\'\\nX\\tsh -c \\'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\"\\'\\nX\\nX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set\\nX    the \\'fix\\' line in the ---entry--- section to \\'y\\' instead of \\'n\\'.\\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\\nX    replaced.\\nX\\nX\\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\\nX\\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\\nX\\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\\nX\\nX\\t---entry--- section\\nX\\tall ---author--- sections\\nX\\tall ---info--- sections\\nX\\t---build--- section\\nX\\t---program--- section\\nX\\tany other text, including the Email message headers\\nX\\nX    Prior to judging, the \\'any other text\\' file is scanned to be sure\\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\\nX\\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\\nX\\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\\nX    Because the main \\'prize\\' of winning is being announced, we make all\\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\\nX    winners at talks)\\nX\\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\\nX\\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\\nX\\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\\nX\\nX\\t* reading the ---entry--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\\nX\\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\\nX\\t    shipping over any #include files\\nX\\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\\nX\\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\\nX\\t    shipping over any #include files\\nX\\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\\nX\\nX\\t* linting the source\\nX\\t* compiling/building the source\\nX\\t* running the program\\nX\\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\\nX\\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\\nX\\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\\nX\\nX\\t* best small one line program\\nX\\t* best small program\\nX\\t* strangest/most creative source layout\\nX\\t* most useful obfuscated program\\nX\\t* best game that is obfuscated\\nX\\t* most creatively obfuscated program\\nX\\t* most deceptive C code\\nX\\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\\nX\\t* best abuse of ANSI C\\nX\\t* worst abuse of the rules\\nX\\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\\nX\\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\\nX\\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\\nX    less clear cut.\\nX\\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry\\nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,\\nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\\nX\\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\\nX    rules in some way.\\nX\\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as \\'best\\'.  Sometimes such\\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\\nX    \\'best\\' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\\nX\\nX\\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\\nX\\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\\nX\\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\\nX\\nX\\t    comp.lang.c\\t\\t  comp.unix.wizards\\talt.sources\\nX\\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\\nX\\nX\\t    comp.sources.d\\t  alt.sources.d\\t\\tmisc.misc\\nX\\t    comp.sources.misc\\t  comp.windows.x\\nX\\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.

It emulates an HP 7570\\nor 7574 - I'm not sure which.  It has an option board on it that does\\nthe emulation.  It has a serial interface with Hardware handshake. I\\nalso have 340 Pens for it as follows:  10 packs of 4 Black Oil based, 16\\npacks of 4 Red,Green, Blue, and Black pens, 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black,\\n7 packs of 4 Aqueous R,G,Blue,Black,  1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi color\\npens,  and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored.\\n\\n    The plotter is used.  I have tested it using the Windows drivers for\\nHP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine.  It accepts either A or B\\nsized paper. (8.5 x 11 or 11x17).\\n\\n    I figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth at\\nleast another $200 more..  One thing is certain, you won't need to\\npurchase any pens for quite a while...  All of the packaged pens were\\nsealed so they are all still fresh.

Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX, I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5, that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.  And my system work flawlessly under this setting.

Affected programs include rgb and \\nthe server.\\n\\n\\tThis is from the GCC manual:\\n\\n\\tOn the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for \\n\\tstructures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument\\n\\tlist, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by \\n\\treference.\\n\\n\\tThis really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet\\n\\tsupported in GNU CC, so it isn\\'t straightforward to fix it.\\n\\n\\tThe convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and\\n\\t`-fpcc-struct-return\\' does not help.\\n\\nYou can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just\\nthe routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with \\ncompilation flags.  \\n\\n\\tFiles which need to be compiled using cc include:\\n\\t\\tserver/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c \\n\\t\\trgb/rgb.c\\n\\n\\tIn addition, several of the \"inet_\" functions use structs as args or\\nreturn values:  \\n\\t\\tclients/xhost/xhost.c \\n\\t\\tclients/xauth/gethost.c. \\nCalls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly \\nharmless as they don\\'t involve structs.\\n\\n[collected by bashford@scripps.edu (Don Bashford); 8/90]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?\\nWhen I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error \\n\\t\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. \\n\\tFatal server bug! no screens found.\"\\n\\n\\tRunning the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn\\'t work.

Although it is not \\nspecific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the \\nconfiguration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.\\n\\tImake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by\\nwhich the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration\\nfiles, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not \\nobvious.\\n\\tThere have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and\\nR5 versions are different.\\n\\n\\tYou can obtain information on imake from these sources:\\n\\t- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on\\nusing Imake to build X\\n\\t- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information\\n\\t- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes\\' R3/R4\\nguide to imake.\\n\\t- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim\\nFulton on an early version of Imake\\n\\t- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful \\nexplanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-\\nsupported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu\\nin the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and \\nconfig-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. \\n[7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;\\nmail a message body of \"send imake-stuff help\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.\\n\\t- see \"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\" by Dinah McNutt\\nin the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.\\n\\t- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \"Das Meta-Make \\n/ I make, you make / Schwerelos\" by Rainer Klute in \"iX \\nMultiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\", directed at application programmers needing to\\nwrite Imakefiles.

An earlier \\nversion is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits \\nredistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the \\ntemplate and configuration files. There are no real standards for such \\nconfiguration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the \\ntemplates distributed with X11R5.\\n\\texport contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake\\nwithout picking up the entire distribution.\\n\\tA stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in\\nftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?\\n\\n\\tIf you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \"xmkmf\". This is a \\nscript which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a \\nMakefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, \\nwhich will use that new Makefile to compile the program.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 109)  Why can\\'t I link to the Xlib shape routines?\\nWhen I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:\\n\\tUndefined:\\n\\t_XShapeQueryExtension\\n\\t_XShapeCombineMask\\n\\n\\tThese routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)\\nwhich was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular\\nwindows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will \\nonly run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many \\nvendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case \\nthey will display rectangular windows anyway.\\n\\n\\tIn order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library \\nlibXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes\\nwill be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do \\nnot despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be \\ncompiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can\\nprobably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X \\nlibraries.\\n\\n[from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 110)  What are these problems with \"_XtInherit not found\" on the Sun?\\nWhen I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the \\nerror \"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\".\\n\\n\\tWhat you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to \\nget Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can\\'t share a function that \\nis both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting \\n_XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby \\nguaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where \\nXtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally\\nbe called.\\n\\n\\tYou are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal\\nXt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. \\n\\t1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a \\nconnection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif\\'s 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called\\nXtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your \\nprogram; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.\\n\\t2) alternatively, your program doesn\\'t need any Xt functions and is\\ncorrect in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView \\nprogram. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. \\n\\n\\tIt should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,\\nalthough this will certainly solve the problem.\\n\\t\\n[from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); \\n11/90]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 111)  Why can\\'t I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?\\nI have a program that worked well under X11R3.

In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but\\nare part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.\\n[10/90]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 113)  Why doesn\\'t my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?\\n\\n\\tThe window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one\\nwindow to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the\\nwindow manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are\\ncalled \"hints\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you\\ncan use something like the following:\\n\\n        XWMHints wmhints;\\n        ...\\n        wmhints.flags = InputHint;\\n        wmhints.input = True;\\n        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)\\n\\nIf your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput \\nresource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don\\'t have\\nsource, you can start up the application with the resource \\'*input:True\\'.\\n\\nCertain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having \\nthis done. \\n\\n\\tIf you are using Sun\\'s OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource\\nto your defaults file to use clients that aren\\'t ICCCM-compliant.\\n\\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true\\n\\n[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?\\n\\n\\tYou can\\'t reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be\\nspoofed in any case. \\n\\tFor most cases, you shouldn\\'t care which window manager is running, so \\nlong as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in \\nwhich particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for\\nparticular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can \\nsidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may \\nbe appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take\\nadvantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm\\'s push-pin menus) in order\\nto give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window \\nmanager\\'s functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;\\nthis surely leads to future compatibility problems.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?\\n\\t\\n\\tThere is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the \\nMacintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development \\nunder a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional \\ndevelopment. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive \\napplication builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good\\napplications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \"test just \\nthis one little thing\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that \\nputs up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for\\nquick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 \\ndistributions, and the Xlib \"Hello World\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and \\nR4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 \\nXlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  \\nby Glenn Widener of Tektronix. \\t[3/90]\\n\\n\\tIn addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute \\nshowing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display \\nconnection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?\\n\\n\\tThe XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is\\nsensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:\\n\\t{\\n\\tArg args[3];\\n\\tint i;\\n\\tint sensitive;\\t\\t/* oops; wrong data type */\\n\\ti=0;\\n\\tXtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;\\n\\tXtGetValues(widget, args, i );\\n\\t...\\n\\t}\\n\\nBut XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; \\ndeclaring the variable \"sensitive\" as Boolean works properly. This problem \\ncomes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types \\nDimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar \\nproblems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you\\nuse the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget\\'s man page.\\n[11/90]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 117)  Why don\\'t XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?\\n\\n\\tYou\\'re probably trying to use these functions from application code.\\nThey should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a \\nparent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising \\nfunctions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use \\nonly by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.\\n\\tThe only way for your application to request a geometry change for a\\nwidget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.\\nAlthough this will result in the widget-internal functions\\' being called, your\\napplication code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the \\nwidgets\\' data becoming corrupted.\\n\\t[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be \\navoided; they shouldn\\'t be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 118)  Why isn\\'t there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?\\n\\n\\tAlthough there are various details of the current implementation of\\nthe Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no\\nsuch call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for\\nthe \"new\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location\\nin the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?\\nWhat should happen to the widget\\'s children? And by the time such semantics are\\ndefined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old \\nwidget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired \\nresources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in \\ncreating a new widget.\\n\\n\\tNote that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDavid B.

It is an S3\\n86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my\\nsecond meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix\\nfrom their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the\\nordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from\\nthem, so I guess I should be glad they didn\\'t just say \"Buy the memory\\nfrom us\" or something like that.)\\n\\n\\tThe one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a\\n1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or\\nenlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB\\nof memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.\\nJust ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn\\'t have bothered.  I\\nasked them why, and all I got was \"Your point is well taken, but\\nOrchid\\'s software developers are busy with other projects.\"\\n\\n\\tSo, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805\\ndrivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I\\'d love to\\nget another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next\\ngeneration of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my\\nsystem and it\\'s not so easy to exchange these things unless they\\'re\\nbroken.\\n\\n\\tIf you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805\\ncards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are \"less\\nbusy\".  If the magazines are to believed, I\\'ve only seen one s3 86c805\\nproduct thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),\\nalthough evenn that might be a misprint.\\n\\n\\tPlease, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out\\nthere, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I\\ncoulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.\\n\\nThanks.\\ndonyee@athena.mit.edu\\n',\n",

We have several\\nNetwork General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on\\nseveral hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, \\n2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility,\\n4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely\\noperated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual \\nmanipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found \\nit 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for\\nmany protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle\\nTCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do\\na reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily\\nmodified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems\\nby adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.\\n\\nTcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and\\nSunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump.\\nIt compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will\\nneed Motif 1.1 or better.\\n\\nThe following files are available for anonymous ftp from \\nftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking\\n\\ntcpview-1.0.tar.Z\\ttcpview and tcpdump source code\\ntcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z\\tSun4 binaries\\ntcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z\\tDEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries\\n\\nWhat tcpview adds to tcpdump:\\n- easier interface\\n- enhanced protocol decoding\\n- hex display of frame\\n- capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt\\n- can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name\\n- ethernet address host table\\n- can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames\\n- can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional\\n\\tprocessing.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1\\n\\nNew features:\\n\\nNow reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.

Features\\n===========\\n\\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\\n\\n\\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\\n\\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\\n\\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\\n\\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\\n\\n - color-space selection\\n\\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\\n\\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\\n\\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\\n\\n...\\n\\n4. Technical information\\n========================\\n\\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\\n\\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\\n\\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\\nareas.\\n\\n...\\n\\n--\\nStefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de\\n\",\n",

We use it to\\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\\nvideo to the Net.\\n\\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\\n\\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\\nfind distracting.\\n\\nIf you can get past this problem, you\\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \\nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\\n\\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\\'ve ever\\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\\'ll recognize the methodology\\nand the user interface.\\n\\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21\" Apple mon-\\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\\n\\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\\nwill look better.\\n\\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.

(Around 5 MB.)\\n\\nI have a Quadra 950. \\nI have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.\\n         (using block-mode transfers)\\nI have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can\\n         achieve 6.8 MB/s.\\n\\nLet\\'s say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.\\n\\nIt is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,\\nthen transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s\\nresult in an overall 3.8 MB/s.

So there is no improvement in the rate.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nIs the mac RAM dual-port?

Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\\n\\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\\n\\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\\nwhat it all means later on). \\n\\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\\n\\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \\nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \\n\\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\\ngraphics and how to use the package.\\n\\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \\nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\\n\\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

In short, I am happy\\nwith the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time\\nfutzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor\\nis pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17\" Magnavox went away.  It\\nisn\\'t as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the\\nmonitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.\\n\\nIn going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors\\nin 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program\\nwhich uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,\\nOrchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those\\nare all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses\\na Weitek VGA chip which also doesn\\'t support them).  The Hercules Graphite\\ncard does seem to have these modes, but I didn\\'t run the same test cases as\\nI did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to\\nprint the splash screen for the Grolier\\'s Encyclopedia, though, which the S3\\ncards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.\\n\\nThe supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if\\nyou tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors\\nlisted plus \\'Generic\\', and if you choose Generic you can\\'t get any high\\nrefreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me\\nthat the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz\\nat 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution\\nwas the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,\\nand it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.\\n\\nThe higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone\\nwith Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don\\'t know what I have) he was unable\\nto recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as\\nhe could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn\\'t have\\nthe problem.  He didn\\'t know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.\\n\\nThe board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules\\nSpeedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results\\nin pixels/second.  I don\\'t have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they\\nwere close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz\\n386, ISA, so the numbers aren\\'t really comparable.  The following numbers\\nwere all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with\\n8 MB memory.

You have to \\nbe mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.\\n\\n\\tKen\\n--\\nKenneth Whaley\\t\\t\\t (408) 748-6347\\nKubota Pacific Computer, Inc.\\t Email: whaley@kpc.com\\n2630 Walsh Avenue\\nSanta Clara, CA.  95051\\n',\n",

The typical\\nX    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not\\nX    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical\\nX    closing date for contests are in early May.\\nX\\nX    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to\\nX    year.

Our agency started to express interest in\\n|> virtual reality(VR).  So far, we do not know much about VR.  All we\\n|> know about are the Hollywood movies \"The Terminater 2\" and \"Lawnmover\\n|> Man\".  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\\n|> Computer Graphics World magazine.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n|> \\n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\\n|> companies,\\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI\\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\\n|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

My\\nmachine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from\\nwhen I called the order in. \\n\\n   Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the \\nperipherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I\\nwas very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway \\ndocumentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals.\\nThe Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came\\nwith build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office)\\nwas properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and \\nhas been performing flawlessly. It\\'s been on all weekend and it hardly\\neven reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a \\nlot to do with it. \\n\\n   It\\'s up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I\\'ve also read about\\nsome people having problems with high speed serial communications. \\nI used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old\\ncomputer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \"maps\" the other\\nmachines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \"cd\" to these\\ndrives and either run programs or copy files. It\\'s almost like a\\npeer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.\\nIt\\'s not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this\\nmachine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the \\npeer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. \\n\\n  My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also\\nby-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430\\ncredit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!\\n\\n  So, I\\'m glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I\\'m glad it\\nwas me.

I am working on a project for my marketing class and I\\'d like to\\nask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a\\nmarketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at\\nthis point.  Well, my group\\'s plan is to market a \"full page\" monitor\\nfor laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed\\nby authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology\\'s PaletteBook\\nscreen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you\\nwould get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,\\ntechnical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen\\nand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \"full\" height. \\nThe screen would probably be monochrome.\\nThe motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very\\npopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word\\nprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient\\nto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and\\napplications, color screens aren\\'t really a neccessity.  We could\\nhopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.\\n\\nNow, please don\\'t write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really\\nneed some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me\\nvia email and let me know:\\n1. If you would consider buying a \"full page\" laptop screen\\n2. How much you would be willing to pay for it\\n3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea\\n\\nAlso, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful,\\nbut who knows!), please send me some.\\n\\nThanks in advance!!!\\n\\n-Mike\\n',\n",

Where can i connect a 3 1/2\" AMP-Connector\\n>to supply my 3 1/2\" HD?\\n\\nIt is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any\\nmacintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came\\nwith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\\n \\nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\\nover two months.\\n\\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don\\'t have a spare\\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\\nshorts or bad connections.\\n\\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn\\'t word so what\\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn\\'t work, my original cable is not\\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\\n\\nHaving done all that, I couldn\\'t be bothered to check the dev notes for\\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\\nday. \\n\\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID\\'s of\\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\\nintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it\\nseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal\\nshould be terminated at all the ends.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any more questions.\\n\\nPeter Hansen\\nBell Northern Research\\npgmoffc@BNR.ca\\n',\n",

      "From  bgrubb dante nmsu edu  GRUBB  Subject  Re  IDE vs SCSI Organization  New Mexico State University  Las Cruces  NM Lines  49 Distribution  world NNTP Posting Host  dante nmsu edu  DXB132 psuvm psu edu writes   SCSI I ranges from 0 5MB s   SCSI II ranges from 0 40MB s   IDE ranges from 0 8 3MB s                                          ESDI is always 1 25MB s  although there are some non standard versions  The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI  SCSI I  8 bit asynchronous   1 5MB s ave   synchronous  5MB s max  transfer  base  SCSI 1 faster  this requires a SCSI 2 controller chip and provides  SCSI 2  8 bit to 16 bit  speeds with SCSI 1 controlers  SCSI 2  4 6MB s with 10MB s burst 8 bit   8 12MB s with 20MB s burst  16 bit    and 15 20MB s with 40MB s burst 32 bit wide and fast    16 bit SCSI can be wide or fast  it depends on how the port is designed The Quadras will support fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the Quardas use a SCSI 1  non wide  port    The article in PC Mag 4 27 93 29 was talking about SCSI 1  SCSI 2 uses TEN  10  devices in it native mode  outside its native mode it behaves a lot like SCSI 1  7 devices  slower through put   From your own figures SCSI 1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out as for  20  faster then IDE  that seems to be 8 bit SCSI 1 using a SCSI 2  contoler chip  The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI 2 controler chip for its SCSI 1 and gets 6MB s through put for asynchronous  8 bit  SCSI 1  far in excess of a normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI 1 output  120  of 8 3 is 9 96 which is near the burst of a SCSI 1 machine with a SCSI 2 controller chip   The PC world seems to have SCSI 1 and SCSI 2 mixed up   Fact is SCSI 2  controler chips allow near SCSI 2 speeds through a SCSI 1 device  As shown in the Mac Quadra  which skews some of the data of SCSI 1 vs IDE or ESDI test  I agree that the article COULD have stated that the  20  faster then IDE  came off a SCSI 1 device with a SCSI 2 chip   Maybe it was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with SCSI 1 NOT SCSI 2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI 1 device with a SCSI 2 controller chip  SCSI 1 chips are limited to 5 MB max   SCSI 1 devices with SCSI 2 chips  becoming common  produce up to 10Mb s in 8 bit mode and 20MB s in 16 bit mode  the fast version  SCSI 1 ports cannot use wide SCSI    Of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI 1 devices HAVE SCSI 2 chips  or more accurately the machine does   This allows the best of BOTH worlds  high SCSI 2 speeds and cheeper SCSI 1 costs  FULL SCSI 2 hardware  port  electronic controller  etc  is VERY expensive   It ALSO creates a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI 1 goes   When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that the article knows what it is talking about  even if it does not tell HOW the figures came about  while  DXB132 psuvm psu edu is throwing out ranges that don t tell SQUAT  Since he IGNORES SCSI 1 devices with SCSI 2 chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended     \n"

One\\nof the major Presbyterian churches in California (St. Andrews -- a \\nMegaChurch in a rich neighborhood) is withholding their support of \\nSynod (amounts to about 10% of the budget of the Synod, which \\ncovers all of Southern CA and Hawaii) until support for a \\npro-homosexual lobbying group (the Lazarus Project) is terminated.\\n[This came from a news report on CNN yesterday -- corrections welcome.]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTim\\n\\n[I think it\\'s time for me to post the FAQ.  \\n\\nThis is an issue throughout the Presbyterian Church.  On the other\\nside, one of the major churches in Cincinnati has been ordaining\\nhomosexual elders, and has ignored Presbytery instructions not to do\\nso.  And the church in Rochester where the judicial commission said\\nthey couldn\\'t install a homosexual pastor has made her an\\n\"evangelist\".  These situations, as well as the one you describe, do\\nnot appear to be stable.  This will certainly be a major topic for the\\nGeneral Assembly next month.  If the church can\\'t come up with a\\nsolution that will let people live with each other, I think we\\'re end\\nup with a split.  Clearly neither side wants that, but I think we\\'ll\\nget pushed into it by actions of both sides.\\n\\n--clh]\\n'"
